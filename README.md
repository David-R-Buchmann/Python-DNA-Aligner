# Python-DNA-Aligner
A repository for multiple variants of DNA aligners coded in Python

Currently work in progress, but will include at least:

  - An aligner completely coded for scratch (with limited use for longer sequences)
  - An aligner coded using the package Biopython and other handy libraries
